        <p style="padding-left:10px ; padding-right: 10px;">Whether you are like me and spend hours every year trying to get the perfect bracket or just 
            need to get picks for a bracket group you now regret joining, the Perfect Bracket Simulator is for you. The simplest way to use 
            the simulator is to use the 'Bracket' dropdown menu in the top right to navigate to the tournament you want to create picks for. 
            Once there, you will see an empty bracket waiting for you to create the perfect combination of stats for your bracket! 
            You can either manually adjust all of the weights on the left side of the website or use one of the preset weight combinations 
            found at the top. Simple as that, you have created a bracket for this years tournament!</p>
            <p style="padding-left:10px ; padding-right: 10px;">Now, if you want to dive a little deeper into the stats, there's more for you. After you have
            created what you believe will be the perfect combination of stats for this years tournament, you can go to the 'Year'
            dropdown menu and see how that combination of stats would have performed in previous tournaments. That's either when you
            start questioning every decision you've ever made or proclaim yourself as a genius based on how your combination would have performed. 
            Either way, you can use these previous years to fine tune your prediction even further.</p>
            <p style="padding-left:10px ; padding-right: 10px;">If you are manually editing the weights of the stats, there are a few tips and
            tricks for you to know. First, a keyboard shortcut to run the combination you have created is by clicking alt+m 
            (ctrl+option+m on Mac) if you are using google chrome. If you don't want a stat to be included in the calculation,
            simply uncheck it. To check/uncheck all of the stats, use the 'Select All / Deselect All' buttons respectively. 
            If you are ever unsure by what a stat means, simply hover over the stat to get a brief description of that stat.
            If you are looking at previous years, the score that bracket would have scored that is shown uses the standard ESPN scoring
            method.</p>
