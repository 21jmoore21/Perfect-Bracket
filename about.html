        <h1 style="padding-left:10px"><a class="heading">The Perfect Bracket Simulator: </a>How It Works</h1>
        <p style="padding-left:10px ; padding-right: 10px; color: black;">Whether you are like me and spend hours every year trying to get the perfect bracket or just 
            need to get picks for a bracket group you now regret joining, the Perfect Bracket Simulator is for you. The simplest way to use 
            the simulator is to use the 'Bracket' dropdown menu in the top right to navigate to the tournament you want to create picks for. 
            Once there, you will see an empty bracket waiting for you to create the perfect combination of stats for your bracket! 
            You can either manually adjust all of the weights on the left side of the website or use one of the preset weight combinations 
            found at the top. Simple as that, you have created a bracket for this years tournament!</p>
            <p style="padding-left:10px ; padding-right: 10px; color: black;">The current presets that we have are an AI Prediction, 3pt Heavy, Random and Perfect. 
            All of these presets are from an artificial intelligence model [these presets are currently a work in progress]. The AI Prediction is focused
            on getting the best results for the previous years overall. If you believe 3's win games, the 3pt Heavy preset is for you, this is a preset that is focused
            on having a high weight placed on 3's. Random will give you a random set of weights. The Perfect preset is a preset we create after 
            the tournament is finished and find a combination of weights that would have predicted the perfect bracket
            for tournament in the year you are currently looking at. Obviously, the perfect preset doesn't work for the upcoming tournament, your job is to find that combination!</p>
            <p style="padding-left:10px ; padding-right: 10px; color: black;">Now, if you want to dive a little deeper into the stats, there's more for you. After you have
            created what you believe will be the perfect combination of stats for this years tournament, you can go to the 'Year'
            dropdown menu and see how that combination of stats would have performed in previous tournaments. That's either when you
            start questioning every decision you've ever made or proclaim yourself as a genius based on how your combination would have performed. 
            Either way, you can use these previous years to fine tune your prediction even further.</p>
            <p style="padding-left:10px ; padding-right: 10px; color: black;">If you are manually editing the weights of the stats, there are a few tips and
            tricks for you to know. First, a keyboard shortcut to run the combination you have created is by clicking alt+m 
            (ctrl+option+m on Mac) if you are using google chrome. If you don't want a stat to be included in the calculation,
            simply uncheck it. To check/uncheck all of the stats, use the 'Select All / Deselect All' buttons respectively.
            If you've found a combination of stats that you believe will work, click the 'Save' button, which will download your weights to a text file.
            You can then easily reload these weights whenever using the 'Load Weights' button and loading that file. 
            If you are ever unsure by what a stat means, simply hover over the stat to get a brief description of that stat.
            If you are looking at previous years, the score that bracket would have scored that is shown uses the standard ESPN scoring
            method.</p>
            <p style="padding-left:10px ; padding-right: 10px; color: black;">The Winner's Matrix shows what percent chance each team has in making each round of
            the tournament. This was created by running 10,000 simulations of the random setting and calculating what percent of the time each team made it to 
          each round. This data is presented in both a table and bracket format.</p>
