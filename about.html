        <h1 style="padding-left:10px"><a class="heading">The Perfect Bracket Simulator: </a>How It Works</h1>


        <h1 class="section_header"><u>Summary</u></h1>

        <p style="padding-left:10px ; padding-right: 10px; color: black;">Whether you are like me and spend hours every year trying to get the perfect bracket or just 
            need to get picks for a bracket group you now regret joining, the Perfect Bracket Simulator is for you. The simplest way to use 
            the simulator is to use the 'Bracket' dropdown menu in the top right to navigate to the tournament you want to create picks for. 
            Once there, you will see an empty bracket waiting for you to create the perfect combination of stats! 
            You can either manually adjust all of the weights on the left side of the website or use one of the preset weight combinations 
            found at the top. Simple as that, you have created a bracket for this years tournament!</p>

            <p style="padding-bottom:20px ; padding-left:10px ; padding-right: 10px; color: black;">Now, if you want to dive a little deeper into the stats, there's more for you. After you have
            created what you believe will be the perfect combination of stats for this years tournament, you can go to the 'Year'
            dropdown menu and see how that combination of stats would have performed in previous tournaments. That's either when you
            start questioning every decision you've ever made or proclaim yourself as a genius based on how your combination would have performed. 
            Either way, you can use these previous years to fine tune your prediction even further.</p>


            <h1 class="section_header"><u>Presets</u></h1>

            <p style="padding-left:10px ; padding-right: 10px; color: black;">The Simplify button allows you to enter what characteristics of a team you believe
            will make them more likely to win the tournament. The Perfect Bracket Simulator will then take these selections, create a set of weights for you and create
            a bracket for you.</p>

            <p style="padding-left:10px ; padding-right: 10px; color: black;">The AI Prediction preset is focused on getting the best results for the past four years 
            on average. After selecting this preset a bracket will be created for you, but you might notice that all of the weights have been deselected and there 
            is no score next to any of the teams, this is because the AI Prediction is based on a larger model than the weights that are displayed on the website.</p>

            <p style="padding-left:10px ; padding-right: 10px; color: black;">The Random preset will give you a set of random weights and create a bracket for you based on that. 
            By default, these random weights will be in the range of 0 to 100, but you can change this range by selecting the dropdown in the Random preset button
            and use the slider to create any range.</p>

            <p style="padding-bottom:20px ; padding-left:10px ; padding-right: 10px; color: black;">The Perfect preset has a few different options in the dropdown menu: one for the overall
            perfect prediction and one for a perfect prediction for each of the previous four years. By default, the overall perfect prediction is selected. This preset
            is optimized to give you the best result for the past four years on average. If you change what year you are looking at, the perfect preset will automatically
            change the default option to the perfect preset for that year. The individual year perfect presets are created after the tourney and are optimized to give an
            idea of what a good combination of weights would have been for that year. Since this individual year preset is optimized for a single year, it will likely produce
            bad results for the other years.</p>


            <h1 class="section_header"><u>Tips & Tricks</u></h1>

            <p style="padding-bottom:20px ; padding-left:10px ; padding-right: 10px; color: black;">If you are manually editing the weights of the stats, there are a few tips and
            tricks for you to know. First, a keyboard shortcut to run the combination you have created is by clicking alt+m 
            (ctrl+option+m on Mac) if you are using google chrome. If you don't want a stat to be included in the calculation,
            simply uncheck it. To check/uncheck all of the stats, use the 'Select All / Deselect All' buttons respectively. If you think your prediction is close,
            but just needs that extra refinement, click the 'Optimize Weights' button and our model will take those weights as a starting point and optimize them
            to give a better prediction for the past four years on average.
            If you've found a combination of stats that you believe will work, click the 'Save' button, which will download your weights to a text file.
            You can then easily reload these weights using the 'Load Weights' button and loading that file. 
            If you are ever unsure about what a stat means, simply hover over the stat to get a brief description of that stat.
            If you are looking at previous years, the score that bracket would have scored uses the standard ESPN scoring
            method.</p>


            <h1 class="section_header"><u>Winner's Matrix</u></h1>

            <p style="padding-bottom:20px ; padding-left:10px ; padding-right: 10px; color: black;">The Winner's Matrix shows what percent chance each team has in making each round of
            the tournament. This was created by running 10,000 simulations of the random setting and calculating what percent of the time each team made it to 
            each round. This data is presented in both a table and bracket format. The Matchup Mode of the Winner's Matrix allows you to test any match up you would like,
            run a given number of simulations and the model will tell you what percent of the time each team would win.</p>
