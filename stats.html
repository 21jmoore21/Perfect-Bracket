        <p style="padding-left:10px ; padding-right: 10px;">All stats for this website are from Sports-Reference.com. After 
            retrieving all of the stats, I used python to do some cleaning up of the data and getting it into a format that fit 
            my use case. Once the data was cleaned up, I knew I would have to scale the stats so that metrics like points per game
            wouldn't have a much larger impact on the combination than other stats like assists per game. In order to even the playing field,
            I scaled all of the data so that for every stat, the team with the highest value for that stat was set to 1,
            the team with the lowest value was set to 0 and all other teams are linearly scaled between the two. For example, if 
            Gonzaga averaged the most ppg out of all teams in the tournament field, their new ppg value would be scaled to 1.</p>
            <p style="padding-left:10px ; padding-right: 10px;">For stats such as ppg, if that stat has a higher weight assigned to 
            it, the teams that averaged a high ppg will be predicted to perform better. For stats such as turnovers, where it is 
            undesirable to have a lot, the data was inverted to ensure that the team who averaged the least amount of turnovers had 
            their TOV value scaled to 1. This means, if the TOV weight is set higher, the teams that took care of the ball will 
            be predicted to perform better.</p>
            <p style="padding-left:10px ; padding-right: 10px;">Once you have the combination of weights set that you believe will
            predict that perfect bracket and hit run, the score for each team will be displayed by the team name in the first round.
            This is helpful in seeing how close two teams are predicted to be, as well as understanding which teams have good stats in some
            areas and others don't. The teams score is not displayed in any rounds other than the first, but the score does not change 
            round per round. If you wish to make slight adjustments to a stat to see how that affects the teams score, simply click on 
            the slider for that stat and use the arrows on your keyboard to make changes in weight by increments of 1.</p>
